GSoup
=====

Gwt Compatible JSoup variant under MIT license. 

Only basic compilation and testing has been performed. I am in the process of adding Gwt Client side tests. 

Feel free to fork and contribute. 

Plans are on to make it a Maven project. As of now simply checkout and add Gwt 2.6.0 libraries as a dependency to the project. 

Best option is to build it using GWT eclipse plugin
